# Example Javascript and Typescript

Here are some javascript and typescript examples to help get started with nodejs.
This example gets the current price of bitcoin from an api and prints it to the console. It demonstrates a lot of the core functionality such as importing and using npm packages, getting data from the web, validating data and logging (printing) it out to the console.

To try out the examples:
1. First install nodejs and visual studio code. [There are instructions here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)
2. [Clone this repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
3. Install the packages with 'npm install'

## Visual Studio Code terminal
Visual studio code has an integrated terminal (Terminal > New Terminal) which can be used to run commands.

```console
cd javascript
npm install
npm start
```

```console
cd typescript
npm install
npm start
```
